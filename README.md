## 🔍 Overview

This project is under active development. The intent is to build a modular, extensible system for [brief purpose here — e.g., *"tracking symbolic drift across dialogues"* or *"resolving recursive prompt templates into actionable execution graphs"*].

Right now, the focus is on:

- Setting up core utilities
- Environment isolation via Conda
- CLI tool integration
- Repository hygiene and modularity
